# Background
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup is seeking a tool to help select applicants for funding who have the highest likelihood of success in their ventures. Using my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I’ll work with the features provided in the dataset to build a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Alphabet Soup’s business team has provided me with a CSV containing data on over 34,000 organizations that have previously received funding. This dataset includes various columns capturing metadata about each organization, such as:

* EIN and NAME: Identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE: Alphabet Soup application type
* AFFILIATION: Affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION: Government organization classification
* USE_CASE: Purpose for the requested funding
* ORGANIZATION: Type of organization
* STATUS: Current operational status
* INCOME_AMT: Income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS: Special considerations for the application
* ASK_AMT: Amount of funding requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL: Indicator of whether the funding was used effectively

# Instructions

Step 1: Preprocess the Data

Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model

Step 3: Optimize the Model

Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model

Step 5: Copy Files Into Repository
